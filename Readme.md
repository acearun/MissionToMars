# Mission to Mars: Build Your Own Robotic Rover  
**A hands-on robotics course inspired by real planetary exploration**

Mission to Mars is a project-based robotics curriculum where students design, build, and program a Mars rover from the ground up. Over two immersive weeks, learners experience authentic engineering work — mechanical design, CAD, electronics, sensors, and software — all tied together by a space exploration theme.

This repository contains the course structure, hardware list, and instructional flow so educators, camps, and robotics programs can run the experience themselves.


## What Makes This Course Different

This is not a step-by-step kit build. Students think, design, test, fail, and iterate — just like engineers working on real missions.

Students will:

- Design and build a functional rover  
- Compare and program differential vs. mecanum drivetrains  
- Learn robot programming using Android Studio and a Rev Robotics Control Hub  
- Design and build a servo-powered robotic arm and claw for simulated Mars sample collection  
- Use CAD to design real robot parts  
- Develop teamwork, communication, and engineering problem-solving skills  
- Present and demo their rover in a final showcase  

The course ends with a Mars Rover Demo Day, where teams present their robot to family and friends.

## Who This Is For

- High school students (Grades 9–12)  
- Summer camps  
- STEM enrichment programs  
- Robotics clubs  
- Schools running short-term engineering intensives  

Students work in teams of 4-6, mirroring real engineering teams.

## Skills Students Learn

| Area | What They Do |
|------|--------------|
| Mechanical Engineering | Build multiple drivetrains and robot mechanisms |
| Robotics Programming | TeleOp control, motor control, servo programming |
| CAD | Design robot components like a claw |
| Systems Integration | Combine drivetrain, arm, sensors, and code |
| Engineering Process | Plan → Build → Test → Iterate |
| Presentation Skills | Technical demos and team presentations |

## Course Structure (2 Weeks)

### Week 1 — Rover Mobility and Foundations

Students build the base rover and learn core robot systems.

- Introduction to tools, safety, and the Mars mission challenge  
- Engineering design principles  
- Build a differential drivetrain  
- Learn robot wiring and Control Hub setup  
- Introduction to Android Studio robot code structure  
- Compare drivetrain performance  
- Build and program a mecanum drivetrain  
- Measure roll, strafe, and turning performance  

### Week 2 — Manipulation, CAD, and Integration

Students turn the rover into a complete exploration robot.

- Learn about servos and actuators  
- Build a robot arm for sample collection  
- Introduction to CAD and design of a custom claw  
- Attach and program the claw  
- Synchronize multi-step robot actions  
- Final integration and practice  
- Showcase Day presentations and demos  

## Hardware Platform

The course is built around a modular FTC-style robotics ecosystem including:

- Control Hub and Driver Hub  
- GoBilda drivetrain components (mecanum and differential)  
- Servos and Motors
- CAD and 3D printing capability  

A full inventory list is included in this repository.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is designed for educators and program leaders.

### Step 1 — Prepare Hardware
- Review the hardware inventory list  
- Order parts per team  
- Prepare laptops with required software  

### Step 2 — Instructor Familiarization
- Review the daily course breakdown  
- Test drivetrain builds  
- Run sample code on hardware  

### Step 3 — Run the Course
- Follow the day-by-day structure  
- Adjust depth based on student experience  
- Emphasize iteration and experimentation, not perfection  
- Have fun robot competitions that encourages creativity and learning from failure

### Step 4 — Host Demo Day
Have each team present:
- Their rover design  
- Engineering challenges they faced  
- A live robot demonstration  

## Teaching Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

- Learning by building  
- Engineering thinking over memorization  
- Team-based problem solving  
- Real-world robotics tools and systems  
- Confidence through creation  

Students leave not just knowing what a robot is, but having engineered one themselves.

## Customization

The curriculum is flexible:

- Reduce coding complexity for younger groups  
- Go deeper into sensors or autonomy for advanced students  
- Add challenges such as speed trials, obstacle courses, or sample retrieval tasks
